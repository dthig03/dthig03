### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Darren and I'm a new software developer.
I recently graduated from a coding boot camp where I learned Java, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue.js. 
I'm currently looking for my first development role, and I hope I can make some cool projects to help build up a portfolio.
I've already learned so much throughout my boot camp and I'm looking forward to learning so much more!
I'm excited to see where these new skills I've acquired will lead me and what projects I'll get to work on in the future!
